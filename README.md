# A. Project Overview

In this project, we aim to build a predictive model to determine whether a person will default on a loan. This classification problem is based on a dataset obtained from **Kaggle**.

## Goal of the Project
The primary objective is to develop a machine learning model that can accurately predict loan default, helping financial institutions minimize risks and improve lending strategies.

## Business Impact
- **Better Risk Management**  
  Helps lenders assess the creditworthiness of applicants, reducing the likelihood of bad loans.
  
- **Optimized Loan Approval Process**  
  Enables financial institutions to approve loans more efficiently while minimizing default risks.
  
- **Improved Profitability**  
  Reducing defaults leads to a healthier loan portfolio, improving overall financial stability.
  
- **Enhanced Customer Relationship**  
  Allows banks to offer personalized interest rates and loan terms based on risk assessment.
