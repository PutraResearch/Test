In this project, we aim to build a predictive model to determine whether a person will default on a loan. This classification problem is based on a dataset obtained from Kaggle.

Goal of the Project
The primary objective is to develop a machine learning model that can accurately predict loan default, helping financial institutions minimize risks and improve lending strategies.
